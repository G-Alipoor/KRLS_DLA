Kernel Recursive Least Squares Dictionary Learning Algorithm

This repository contains all codes (in MATLAB) and the Dataset necessary for reproducing the results reported in our submitted paper entitled “Kernel Recursive Least Squares Dictionary Learning Algorithm”.

•	The Data folder contains datasets, whose description is provided in the paper.

•	The Functions folder contains all functions developed for simulating the proposed as well as other dictionary learning algorithms.

•	The Tests folder contains all functions developed to test the algorithms. All results reported in the paper can be simply reproduced by running the tetst.m routine.

•	The Results folder contains the results; results produced by running each test routine are saved in this folder. Although the reported results, including mat files and figures, are already located in this folder, they can be reproduced by running the corresponding routine.
